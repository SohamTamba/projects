During the summer of 2018, I participated as a Student Software Developer in Google Summer of Code 2018. I implemented high performance graph analysis algorithms for Julia's LightGraphs library. I was tasked with improving the performance of the code in Julia's [LightGraphs library](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/LightGraphs.jl). To mention a few of the results:
* Reduced the execution time of PageRank by 63.54%
* Presented project results at Julia Conference 2018, University College London to an audience of 50
* Merged 2,500 lines of code into the LightGraphs codebase


A summary of my results were published in Julia's official blog and can be found [`here`](https://julialang.org/blog/2019/02/light-graphs/)
