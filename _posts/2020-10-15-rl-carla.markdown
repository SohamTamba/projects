description: The CARLA <b>Autonomous Driving</b> Challenge 2020 is organized as part of the Machine Learning for Autonomous Driving Workshop at <b>NeurIPS</b> 2020. It involves training an autonomous agent to drive a car in a variety of traffic situations. This is my project for NYU's Deep Reinforcement Learning course, taught by Prof. Lerrel Pinto (<i>NYU</i>). <br> This post will be updated after the course project deadline, which is 11<sup>th</sup> December, 2020.

During the Fall of 2020, I was enrolled in NYU's *Deep Reinforcement Learning course*, taught by Prof. *Lerrel Pinto*. For my course project, I chose to work on the CARLA Autonomous Driving Challenge, which involves training an autonomous agent to drive a car in a variety of traffic situations, in the CARLA simulator. The agent is provided low level inputs such as images taken from a camera on the car, and high level instructions, such as "turn left at longitude 40 and lattitude 30". The agent must use this input navigate from its starting point to a pre-determined end-point. The competition is organized by Neurips. More details about the challenge can be found [`here`](https://leaderboard.carla.org/challenge/).

We will be focusing on generating a good representation of the low level input.

This post will be updated after the course project deadline on 11<sup>th</sup> December.
